# Source-Code-Analysis-Viewer
Browser based application to view Java source code analysis in the form of class diagrams, dependency graphs, etc. It is dependent on the existance of a neo4j graph database (which would be created via the https://github.com/mwemmie/dependency-analyzer project).

The UI is very rough and sloppy at this point - I'm not an experienced JS developer so it's pretty hacky.  Getting better at JS is on the TODO list :)
